**Data Creation**: Simulates customer device data (screen time, browsing activity, location stability). Includes credit score and past loan default history.

**Feature Engineering**: Defines loan approval criteria (based on credit score, past defaults, and stability).

**Model Training**: Uses logistic regression to predict loan approval. Splits data into training and test sets.

**Model Evaluation**: Computes accuracy score and confusion matrix.

**Visualization**: Displays loan approval vs. rejection rates as a bar chart.
